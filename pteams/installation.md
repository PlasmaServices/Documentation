# Installation

Requirements:

* MongoDB
* Java 8+
* 1.8-1.21 Spigot/Paper
* Vault
* _PlaceholderAPI (Optional)_



First, ensure you have all the required dependencies.

Then, upload the pTeams.jar file you downloaded from our store or BuiltByBit.

Then, restart your server and enter your license into the file at `plugins/pTeams/license.yml`

You will then need to enter your MongoDB URI into the file at `plugins/pTeams/storage.yml`

If you do not have a MongoDB, we recommend purchasing one at [https://plasmahost.net](https://plasmahost.net).

Once you have entered your MongoDB information into the `storage.yml` file, restart your server.

pTeams is now ready to be configured and used however you decide!
