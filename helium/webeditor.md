# WebEditor

To use Helium's Web Editor, you will need to allocate an extra port to your server. If you are using Pterodactyl, navigate to your Admin panel.

Once there, click servers, then your server, and click Build Configuration.

Add a new port of allocation to your server.

Then in Helium settings.yml, change the port and domain to what you set.
