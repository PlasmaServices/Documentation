# Installation

Requirements:

* MongoDB
* Redis
* Java 8+
* 1.8-1.21 Spigot/Paper
* PlaceholderAPI



First, ensure you have all the required dependencies.

Then, upload the hBukkit.jar file you downloaded from our store or BuiltByBit.

Then, restart your server and enter your license into the file at `plugins/Helium/license.yml`

You will then need to enter your MongoDB and Redis information into the file at `plugins/Helium/storage.yml`. If you do not have a MongoDB or Redis server, we recommend purchasing one at [https://plasmahost.net](https://plasmahost.net).

Once you have entered your MongoDB and Redis information into the `storage.yml` file, restart your server.

Helium is now ready to be configured and used however you decide!
