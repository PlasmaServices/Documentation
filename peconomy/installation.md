# Installation

Requirements:

* [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
* _(Optional)_ [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)



First, ensure you have all the required dependencies.

Then, upload the pEconomy-\<version>.jar file you downloaded from our store or BuiltByBit.

Then, restart your server and if you purchased the MongoDB Extension, enter your license into the file at `plugins/pEconomy/license.yml` and your MongoDB information into the file at <kbd>plugins/pEconomy/storage.yml</kbd>

If you do not have a MongoDB server, we recommend purchasing one at [https://plasmahost.net](https://plasmahost.net).

If applicable, once you have entered your MongoDB information into the `storage.yml` file, restart your server.

pEconomy is now ready to be configured and used however you decide!
