# Installation

Requirements:

* MongoDB
* Java 17+
* Java Discord Bot Egg



First, ensure you have all the required dependencies.

Then, upload the PlasmaBot.jar file you downloaded from our store or BuiltByBit.

Then, restart your server and enter your license into the file at `/settings.yml`&#x20;

You will then need to enter your MongoDB and Bot Token information into the file at `/settings.yml`. If you do not have a MongoDB or bot server, we recommend purchasing one at [https://plasmahost.net](https://plasmahost.net).

Once you have entered your MongoDB, License, and Bot Token information into the `settings.yml` file, restart your server.

PlasmaBot is now ready to be configured and used however you decide!

Make sure you check language.yml so you can make any needed changes!
